# TODO

## blockers

## caveats

* if scaleway is slow, weave may not bootstrap correctly perhaps? If your slave nodes stay 'NotReady' and weave pods are bellyaching, try again, perhaps when scaleway is less busy?

## changes

* removed DO; ufw has a lot of hacks for SCW now
* we're now running on C2S, not VC2S so we can feed extra volumes to gluster in the future
* default cluster is brought up with 50G root volume and 50G gluster volume. This comes out to about EUR 30,- a month, not 10!
* some small tweaks to make our cluster ready for gluster

## gluster steps

* you can use [gluster-kubernetes](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes) to set up your gluster env
  * fill in your topology.json: hostnames as in kubectl, storage as in wireguard wg0 IP addresses, devices e.g. /dev/nbd1
  * you will need to change the glusterfs-daemonset to tolerate running on the kube-master; in my opinion this is not a huge deal; we've got 4cores, 8GB on this master, not the 2core 2GB as on the VC1S
    ```
          tolerations:
          - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
            operator: Equal
            effect: NoSchedule
    ```
  * it may not be immediately apparent to you that the gluster-kubernetes './gk-deploy' script must be executed on the kubernetes nodes themselves; this is because heketi-cli is connecting to internal ClusterIP's to deploy. 
    * [PR 155](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/pull/155) is not yet merged, uses ansible to deploy on our existing SCW cluster
    * [PR 168](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-kubernetes/pull/168) was closed, but is valid **except if you need to run the glusterfs-daemonset on your master was well, as above.** If you have a non-storage master, this should suit you, though.
    * you'll need heketi-cli and a working kubectl on the node you execute gk-deploy




# Kubernetes cluster setup automation

> This is part of the Hobby Kube project. Functionality of the modules is described in the [guide](https://github.com/hobby-kube/guide).

Deploy a secure Kubernetes cluster on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Setup

### Requirements

The following packages are required to be installed locally:

```sh
brew install terraform kubectl jq wireguard-tools
```

Modules are using ssh-agent for remote operations. Add your SSH key with `ssh-add -K` if Terraform repeatedly fails to connect to remote hosts.

### Configuration

Export the following environment variables depending on the modules you're using.

#### Using Scaleway as provider

```sh
export TF_VAR_scaleway_organization=<ACCESS_KEY>
export TF_VAR_scaleway_token=<TOKEN>
```

#### Using Cloudflare for DNS entries

```sh
export TF_VAR_domain=<domain> # e.g. example.org
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_email=<email>
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_token=<token>
```

### Usage

```sh
# fetch the required modules
$ terraform get

# see what `terraform apply` will do
$ terraform plan

# execute it
$ terraform apply
```

## Using modules independently

Modules in this repository can be used independently:

```
module "kubernetes" {
  source  = "github.com/hobby-kube/provisioning/service/kubernetes"
}
```

After adding this to your plan, run `terraform get` to fetch the module.
